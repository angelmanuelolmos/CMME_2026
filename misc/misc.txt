
First, download the Node windows installer: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Open a cmd window and change directory to the project root, enter: cd cmme-editor-ts

Then enter: npm install

This will install the typescript compiler, and a testing http server.


Second, install VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

You can now open the project root folder in VSCode.

To launch the HTTP server, in the VSCode Terminal window, enter: npm run start


Now clicking 'run and debug' will 
1) Compile all typescript into javascript, and copy it into the WWW folder.
2) Launch a browser to test on.

To switch between compiling Applet and Editor versions, locate file: src/test/index.ts
Change var applet:boolean = true; to false.
